            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a highly motivated and passionate computer science
                professional with a strong academic background and practical
                experience in various areas of the field. I hold a
                Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sepuluh Nopember
                Institute of Technology, where I gained a solid foundation
                in programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and
                computer architecture.
                <br /><br />
                During my studies, I actively participated in programming
                competitions and coding challenges, which enhanced my
                problem-solving skills and ability to work under pressure. I
                also took part in several projects, both individually and as
                part of a team, where I developed software applications,
                conducted rigorous testing, and implemented innovative
                solutions. <br /><br />
                Additionally, I have gained hands-on experience through
                internships at leading tech companies. In these roles, I had
                the opportunity to collaborate with seasoned professionals,
                contributing to the development of cutting-edge software
                products and refining my skills in areas such as software
                engineering, database management, and web development.
                <br /><br />
                My expertise extends to various programming languages such
                as Java, Python, and C++, as well as familiarity with web
                technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also
                worked with frameworks and tools such as Django, React, and
                Git, enabling me to build scalable and efficient
                applications.
                <br /><br />
                Beyond technical skills, I possess excellent analytical
                abilities and a strong aptitude for problem-solving. I have
                a keen interest in exploring emerging technologies such as
                artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
                cybersecurity. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and
                stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.
                <br /><br />
                As a computer science professional, I am not only proficient
                in the technical aspects but also have excellent
                communication and collaboration skills. I am adept at
                conveying complex concepts to both technical and
                non-technical audiences, which has been beneficial in
                presenting my work and collaborating with cross-functional
                teams.
                <br /><br />
                In summary, I am a dedicated computer science professional
                with a comprehensive skill set, a drive for continuous
                learning, and a passion for leveraging technology to solve
                real-world problems. I am excited about contributing to
                innovative projects and making a positive impact in the
                ever-evolving world of computer science.
